PAIRING

Two people working together in code
On one computer
Alternating roles!

DRIVER: Gets to touch the keyboard, asks questions about code, practices execution, "hands on keyboard time"

NAVIGATOR: Does not touch the keyboard, researches/guides the coding process, practices comms/planning, "chin in hand time"

Recommended: set a timer and switch roles every 30 min, no matter what.
Also great: switch after each feature (must be aware of the fair share)

BEFORE:

- ALWAYS begin with a checkin
  -how am i feeling
  -where am I at with material
  -pressures on me from school/etc that will affect my attentiveness/comms/etc
  -schedule/breaks/switchoff strategy
  -define roles for you two

Make no small plans
Radiate positivity
Pursue mastery
Be scrappy
Work together
