# Forms And Validations

## OBJECTIVES

- Understand the "object lifecycle" and where validations happen in that cycle
- Add validations to models to keep undesired data out of the database
- Explore validation methods e.g. `object.valid?`,  `object.errors`, and `object.errors.full_messages` 
- Set up our controllers to allow for the possibility of bad data coming in during a post (or an update)
- Add errors to forms to help users give us better data
- Manage redirecting vs rendering in the controller and conditional display in the view to put it all together
